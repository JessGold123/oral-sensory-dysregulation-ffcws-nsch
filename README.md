# Picky Eating and Emotion Dysregulation in Children

This repository contains a pre-analysis plan and supporting materials for a secondary data project examining the relationship between feeding behaviors, specifically **picky eating** and **low interest in food**, and **emotion dysregulation** in children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The project uses data from the **2023 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH)**.

## Project Overview

This project investigates how feeding behaviors relate to parent-reported emotion dysregulation in children aged 6–11 years. We examine:
- Whether associations differ by **neurodevelopmental status** (autistic vs. non-autistic children)
- Whether relationships are moderated by **autism severity**, **treatment status**, or **age of diagnosis** within the ASD subgroup

Findings from this project are intended to clarify whether surface feeding behaviors reflect common emotional vulnerabilities or diverge across neurodevelopmental contexts.

## Aims

1. **Aim 1:** Examine whether picky eating and low interest in food are associated with emotion dysregulation in children with and without autism.  
2. **Aim 2:** Within the ASD subgroup, test whether autism severity, treatment status, or age of diagnosis further shapes these pathways.

## Dataset
- **Source:** 2023 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH)
- **Sample:** Children aged **6–11 years**
- **Rationale:** Age restriction reduces the influence of adolescent behavioral masking and aligns more closely with the age range targeted in the original FFCWS plan

## Proposal Version History
- **August 2025 — v3.0:**  
  Original plan included both NSCH and the *Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS)* to examine developmental pathways. Due to restricted FFCWS access and limited   time, the project has been narrowed to focus solely on NSCH data.  
  
- **July 2025 — v2.0:**  
  Age restriction to 6–11 (FORMTYPE = T2) added to improve measurement validity and comparability across samples. Exploratory adolescent analysis (12–17; T3) proposed.

- **June 2025 — v1.0:**  
  Initial concept focused on oral sensory processing and its relationship to dysregulation. Reframed in later versions to emphasize feeding behavior over sensory traits.
